**VService** is a general architecture which based on Spring Boot/Spring Cloud. All my thoughts are that coding should be easy and amusing, and hope you have fun. Finally, please allow me to show my rural english.

## Features

- General templates: Replace middleware without modifying any codes and code in a unanimous way.
- Introduced on demand: Minimize engineering volume and improve performance.
- Highly customizable: The project would perform as you think by adjusting configuration.
- Compatible with native: Code as you learn anywhere if you want.
